# UQNuc

The original torch code folder (orig_torch_code) has the full application that I want to port. 
The main file there is uq.py(the execution starts there)

I have made a smaller scale version of that code in the sambanova folder(nuclear_response_samba), 
which is what I am working on.

The compile command is, we execute this after we cd into the sambanova folder
